## Installation in MicroManger

In order to get CLIJ accessible from [MicroManager 2.0 gamma](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/~MM/nightlyBuilds/2.0.0-gamma/Windows/) scripting interface, please copy these files from the recent [CLIJ release](https://github.com/clij/clij/releases) into the `/plugins/` directory of MicroManager:
* clij-coremem.jar
* clij-clearcl.jar
* clij-core.jar

Afterwards, restart MicroManager. You can try if it works by running [this beanshell script](https://github.com/clij/clij-docs/blob/master/src/main/beanshell/clij_micromanager.bsh) to see if it works.
